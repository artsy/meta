# Happy Hours at Artsy

Happy Hours are a long-standing event at Artsy where employees get together and invite our partners, friends, artists and fellow engineers.

It's held inside our offices, on a weekly basis. We strive to make them full of people across the tech & arts spectrum. Other than friends we tend to invite great candidates that we might not be currently interested in, but maybe will be in the future.

There are small snacks, drinks (including beer, wine, whiskey, etc.). We have a bartender.
