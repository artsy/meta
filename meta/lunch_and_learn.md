# Lunch & Learn

When Artsy was under 50 people, we would hold "Brown Bag" meetings. These were talks on a variety of art+science topics. Sometimes they had a very general audience and sometimes they had a deeply technical audience. As we've grown, we've grown that concept into Lunch & Learns.

## Format & Audience

Our format is pretty simple, every Thursday we have an hour slot at 12 (NYC time) on the calendar for someone to give a talk or presentation. [Alan](http://twitter.com/alanjay1/) described it well on [Professional Development at Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/09/22/professional-development-at-artsy-engineering/):

> Every Thursday, we do a Lunch-and-Learn session. Historically, we mostly showed off tech we use internally. But over about a year, most of our tech stack has been presented this way, so we also bring in engineers we know at other companies to share what they’re working on.

The format is definitely not set in stone, however these are what has worked for us internally and for past contributors.

The **audience** of the Lunch & Learns spans from just our engineering team all the way up to the entire company. Each Lunch & Learn is different. When promoting the Lunch & Learns internally (in staff newsletters and calendar invitations), we try to clarify who the audience is for that specific talk. This gives us the flexibility to have talks like "How to Automate Docker Deploys" and also "How to Build Effective Business Teams" in the same series of talks.

## Giving a Talk

You're probably seeing this as someone external to Artsy, who has been invited to talk. Please note that nothing about this format is set in stone; we are happy to work with you to figure out a format that works for you and your talk.

#### Presentation

Traditional conference/meetup style: You bring slides, we watch. You talk, we listen. You finish, we ask questions.

We don't expect conference/meetup-level presentation or practice. A lack of polish is okay. This is a great opportunity to present new talks ideas.

#### Company Walkthrough

More informal, you can come with other speakers and talk about the ways in which your company works. Covering your tech stack, the decisions behind them. With the presentation mainly being a series of demos, and showing code architecture.

### Schedule

* Arrive at Artsy for 11:45am (we're [401 Broadway, 26th Floor, 10013][401] - Canal St is the closest station)
* Our receptionist will get in touch with whoever you've been in contact with, probably [Orta] or [Ash]
* They will get you set up on our 27th floor Classroom
* We will set up [a stream](#recording) for global developers and slides
* There are inevitable technical difficulties (~10 minutes)
* You give a presentation (~30 minutes)
* We ask a bunch of questions (~15 minutes)
* Whoever helped get you set up takes you out for lunch on us

Artsy Engineering now owes you, and your company [a talk back](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/teaching-and-learning-1). Feel free to arrange that whenever you like.

### Recording

We ask that we can share a livestream of your talk, because we have a lot of [global developers](https://www.artsy.net/article/eloy-duran-going-global-5-tips-to-make-remote-work). This is just loading a Zoom.us link on your computer and sharing your screen. We'd like to get a copy of your slides, too. Of course, we're happy to send you a copy of the recording.

If you don't want to be recorded, we understand that you might talk and show things that are private. We can skip the screen recording. We will not share anything externally without your express opinion.
