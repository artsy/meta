# Show & Tell

Show & Tell is a new weekly event we're trying out to get more visibility into what our teammates have been working on recently. It is scheduled weekly for a half hour each week (see the shared Engineering Open Meetings calendar) and consists of three ten-minute walkthroughs. These walkthroughs are a presentation of works-in-progress and *no* preparation is expected of these presenters. We look for volunteers at [Monday standups](open_standup.md).

Previous demos include:

- Cool things with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) and [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com) by @anandaroop.
- Initial work on the new [CocoaPods metadata service](https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-metadata-service) by @orta.

It's still early in the process so we're looking forward to how this event can grow and encourage cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing.
