# Dev Team Standup at Artsy

We've been doing engineering standups for as long as there has been an engineering team. The formats have changed over
time as the size and scope of Artsy has changed. We're now on our fourth iteration of this process.

A standup is ideally ran by two people, one person talking, the other taking notes. Decide amongst yourselves which of you will do the before standup stuff.

**Note**: We document our standup process to the degree that _anyone_ on our team can run the standup because we believe that _everyone_ should run at least one meeting. These standups are important for team cohesion and cross-team knowledge sharing; they are an organization-wide responsibility and every engineer should participate.

### Ten minutes before a standup

* The person handling the talking parts `@here`s the dev channel. Include where the meeting is in the NYC office (usually the Classroom).
* The same person reminds the project leads in #dev to prepare their tweet-sized updates, something like this:

> friendly reminder: we’re doing tweet-sized updates from project leads during open standup so have yours ready! /cc @list @of @leads

### During standup

* We start off with props, as a nod towards [People are Paramount][pplp]
* Then we get an update from the CTO
* Then an update from the Product team
* Each tech lead gives a summary of what their teams have been up to
  * If the stand-up is straight after sprint kickoff, skip this section and thank people for giving their demos
  * You can get the projects from the [Sprint Kickoff][sk] google sheet
* We leave a spot for potential cross-team issues
* We have a spot to talk about things people are proud of
* We then either announce [the Lunch & Learn][ll], or try find one for the week

During the standup, someone writes up these notes and passes them out on to slack after.
Everyone leaves links to things they have commented on during the meeting, if they don't, we chase them up.
