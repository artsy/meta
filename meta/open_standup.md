# Dev Team Standup at Artsy

We've been doing engineering standups for as long as there has been an engineering team. The formats have changed over
time as the size and scope of Artsy has changed. We're now on our fourth iteration of this process.

A standup is ideally ran by two people, one person talking, the other taking notes. Decide amongst yourselves which of
you will do the before standup stuff.

**Note**: We document our standup process to the degree that _anyone_ on our team can run the standup because we believe
that _everyone_ should run at least one meeting. These standups are important for team cohesion and cross-team knowledge
sharing; they are an organization-wide responsibility and every engineer should participate.

### Ten minutes before a standup

* Whichever two engineers are beginning their on-call rotation are responsibility for running the standup. Pick one person to run the talking parts, and one person to take notes.
* The person handling the talking parts `@here`s the dev channel. Include where the meeting is in the NYC office
  (usually the Classroom).
* The same person reminds last week's on-call staff in #dev to prepare their updates about last week's rotation. Something like:
  > @personA @personB reminder, we're looking for a list of major or notable incidents from last week during standup.
* The same person reminds the team leads in #dev to prepare their tweet-sized updates, something like this:
  > friendly reminder: we’re doing summary updates from tech leads during open standup, so have yours ready! 
  > /cc @tech-leads

### What is a good update?

* Should focus on status of product work
* Raises larger technical changes which affect other teams
* Talks about the team effort rather than an individual's work

### During standup

* We start off with props, as a nod towards [People are Paramount][pplp]
* Then we get an update from the CTO
* Then an update from the Product team (someone should be present to give one)
* Then an update from last week's on-call support team, including follow-up work items
* Each tech lead gives a summary of what their teams have been up to
* We leave a spot for potential cross-team issues
* We have a spot to talk about things people are proud of
* We then either announce [the Lunch & Learn][ll], or try find one for the week

During the standup, someone writes up these notes and passes them out on to Slack after. Everyone leaves links to things
they have commented on during the meeting, if they don't, we chase them up.
