# Dev Team Standup at Artsy

We've been doing engineering standups for as long as there has been an engineering team. The formats have changed over
time as the size and scope of Artsy has changed. We're now on our fourth iteration of this process.

A standup is ideally ran by two people, one person talking, the other taking notes.

### Before a standup

* All team leads are requested for updates [via Geekbot](https://geekbot.io) which appears in our engineer team slack.
* Someone `@here`s the dev channel with a link and where the meeting is in the NYC office

### During standup

* We start off with props, as a nod towards [People are Paramount][pplp]
* Then we get an update from the CTO
* Each team lead gives a summary of what their teams have been up to
* We leave a spot for potential cross-team issues
* We have a spot to talk about things people are proud of
* We then either announce [the Lunch & Learn][ll], or try find one for the week

During the standup, someone writes up these notes and passes them out on to slack after.
Everyone leaves links to things they have commented on during the meeting, if they don't, we chase them up.
