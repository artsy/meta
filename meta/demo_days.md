# Demo Days at Artsy

Demo Days are a way of showing off shipped projects to the rest of the team. It's a collection of 4-6 projects,
explained by the people who contributed to them; product managers, designers and programmers.

There are three separate roles involved in pulling a demo day off:

* Slides / Project Coordinator
* MC
* Technical Support

Most of the work is done before-hand in preparing the deck, and deciding what to show. This is the role of the
slides/project coordinator. They need to:

* Start the process by going to the [Sprint Kickoff][kickoff] slides
* Make sure to find the sprint that’s just ending
* Get all the tech leads names
* Make a message to everyone asking for what they can do
* Something like: “@x, @y, @z - you were all tech leads on this sprint, does your projecy you have anything good to
  demo?”
* Collect feedback on what we could do, poke one people privately
* Open the last demo day slides, and make a copy with a new date
* Paste the link in Slack as you start to fill out who is speaking
* Get the projects decided, add them to the white overview slides
* Add a black slide for each person
* Add the projects to the wine section at the end

### 60m before

* Announce on slack that it’s happening

e.g.

>     @here in 60m, on the 24th floor in NYC, we’re going to do the product demo day. Which is where we show off what’s shipping or has been shipped this sprint.

* Test all the mics
* Move the stand in front of projector

## Running a demo day presentation

You need two people:

* An MC, who speaks and introduces projects
* A tech person, who tracks slack for technical issues ( volume, mics etc )
* And ideally someone else who can give away the wine at the end.

The presentation work is mostly handled by the MC

* The MC start by offering an explanation of what demo days are
* Then covers an overview of the major projects
* Introduces the speakers etc
* Helps out with tech support on stage
* Once all takos are done, they request the wine

* The tech person monitors #general and #demo-days for requests

### After

* Turn off the recording
* Finish the zoom meeting
* Check you mail for the recordin
* Put it in the Artsy Videos dropbox folder
* Send out another message (no @here though) with the video in #general
